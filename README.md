# Pathpoint V1 has been DEPRECATED.  It has been replaced with [Pathpoint V2](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/business-observability/intro-pathpoint/)

## This repository is for reference only.   

New Relic has introduced Patpoint V2 which offers numerous enhancements including

- Ability to manage more than one flow per instance
- Tight linkage between signals (formerly touchpoints) to NR platform entities and alerts
- Unique playback mode for highly granular exploration of previous time periods
- New UI look and feel more in line w/ platform standards
- Easier creation of stages, steps and touchpoints
- Ability to import and export configurations in "laout only" mode.

## The following resources will help you get started with V2
- [Introduction to Pathpoint V2](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/business-observability/intro-pathpoint/)
- [Installing Pathpoint V2](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/business-observability/install-pathpoint/)
- The old Pathpoint V1 README file was renamed to README-OLD.md
