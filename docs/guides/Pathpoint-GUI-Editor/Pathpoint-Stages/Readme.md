## <a id="intro_to_gui"></a>Intro to the NEW GUI version of Pathpoint ###

In this guide, written for users of version 1.6.4 of New Relic’s Pathpoint, you will see how to manually change/configure the Stages/Steps/Touchpoints and KPIs of your Pathpoint using its GUI (which allows you to make changes to the configuration of your Pathpoint mostly using your mouse), which is something that in previous versions of Pathpoint could only be done using a JSON configuration file. 

Now, to work with this NEW GUI version of Pathpoint, it has to have the GUI feature enabled.


![image](screenshots/gui0.png)

To see if the Pathpoint has its GUI feature enabled, look for the grey settings button, to the right of either the Stages, Steps, Touchpoints, or KPIs name, if you see it, then this feature is enabled, if you don’t see it, then you can enable it, to use it.

These are the steps to  enable the Pathpoint GUI feature: 

1. Click on the 3 lines, to the left of the Pathpoint logo.  
2. Next, in front of “GUI Editor”, click on the red “OFF” button (meaning the GUI is disabled), to enable it. Now you should see the GUI Editor button turn green. 
3. Finally click on the “X”, above “Setup”, to close this dialog box window.

Now, you can easily make changes to your Pathpoint configuration with your mouse using the instructions that follow, something that before version 1.6.4 was only possible using a JSON configuration file.

## <a id="work_with_logo"></a>How to work with the Logo feature of Pathpoint ###
In this version of Pathpoint, you can add or change the Logo of your Pathpoint App, to a new one. 

![image](screenshots/logo1.png)  
To change the logo, of your Pathpoint App, click on the Settings button, to the right of the Pathpoint logo. 
Now, a Windows dialog box window opens up, where you can make the changes necessary to select a new logo for your Pathpoint App.  

![image](screenshots/logo2.png)

These are the steps to select a NEW logo or change the current one of your Pathpoint:

1. Click on the space, where it says “By URL”, and select the way you would like to change/add the Logo (the choices are: "By URL", "Text", or "Default"), for instance, to add it using the URL of an image you’ve saved/found on the internet, select “By URL”.
2. Now, click on the Dimensions space, and write/paste the URL of an image you’ve saved/found on the internet that you would like to use for the new logo (the dimensions of this logo have to be 45 x 27).  
3. Next, click on the “Save Update” button, to save your changes.

If you chose to use the URL method, and it linked to an image of the correct size, the new Logo should render on the Pathpoint GUI (if not fix it). You can change the Logo of your Pathpoint App as many times as you like. Now, if instead of URL, you chose to use "Text", as the logo, you can write up to 28 characters, and once you click on “Save Update” the text you’ve written, will replace the logo shown (if there was one).
