## <a id="steps"></a>How to change the configuration of the Steps of your Pathpoint using its GUI ##
Steps represent the various actions/events occurring throughout the stage. They can be placed in the traditional sequential manner of steps 1,2,3.., but also in a parallel form to represent optional and simultaneous actions and activities. The title of the Step corresponds to the name with which the Step is identified.  And every Step of a Pathpoint is connected to one or more Touchpoints and Every Stage Status is based on the culmination of its respective Touchpoints.

## <a id="Steps_order_of_steps"></a>How to change the order level of a line of Steps ###
This is something that before this version of Pathpoint, 1.6.4, could only be done using the JSON configuration file, now the same thing can be accomplished with a few clicks of the mouse.

This is the way to work with the configuration of the Steps, to change the level # of a line of Steps: 
 
1. Begin by selecting the Stage under which you would like to work, for instance, “Order”.  
2. Now, select the level of the Steps you would like to change, for instance, the second one. 
3. Click on the # shown on the level line, if you would like to change it to a different #. For instance, if the line of Steps is the second one, click on the number you see and change it to another one, for instance, select line # 3, which moves the whole line of Steps from the second line to the third position of Steps.  
 
To save these changes click on “Save Update”. Later on, you can change this line, to another level, or change to the original level, in this case, level # 2.
