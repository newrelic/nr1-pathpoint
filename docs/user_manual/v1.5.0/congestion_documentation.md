## New Congestion algorithm (1.5.4)

A new way to calculate congestion is implemented, based on the formule developed. 
- ***It uses the Count touchpoints, PCC and PRC***<br>
- ***It adds a new property to the tuning, defining the max acceptable value.*** <br>
## "Max transaction Count‚Äù in the figure <br>

- ***It is required at least 2 count touchpoints in a stage for the formule to work.***<br> 
It is defined that a touchpoint is congested when its value is over the max defined in the tuning, the more it is over that value, the more congested the touchpoint is.<br> 
***Example:*** <br>

***Formula***<br>
What is causing Congestion: Values over Max value set in tuning <br>
- ***Total Congestion Value:	 Sum of all values that are above max set value*** <br>
- ***Total Count Value: Sum of all touchpoints values*** <br>
- ***Congestion Percentage = Hundred multiplied by the total congestion Value divided by the total count value*** <br>
